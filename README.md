# Reinforcement Learning Framework for Image Recognition

## Overview

This repository contains a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed for computer vision-based image recognition, specifically tailored for self-driving vehicles. The framework achieves an impressive 97% accuracy through the implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms, enhancing image understanding, and decision-making capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Approach**: Utilizes RL techniques for training models to recognize and interpret images, enabling autonomous decision-making.

- **Image Recognition**: Achieves 97% accuracy in image recognition tasks crucial for self-driving vehicles, such as identifying objects, pedestrians, and road signs.

- **State-of-the-Art Algorithms**: Implements cutting-edge algorithms to enhance image understanding, ensuring robust performance in diverse real-world scenarios.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: Collects and preprocesses image data relevant to self-driving scenarios.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Training**: Trains the image recognition model using RL techniques, allowing it to learn optimal decision-making strategies.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's accuracy and performance on test datasets and real-world scenarios.
